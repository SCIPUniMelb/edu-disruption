## Aim 
Evaluate the use of APIs (Application Programming Interface) as a method of data collection.

## Scope {.tabset}

### APIs for data collection
While humans can easily interpret information the displayed on a web page, computers need more help. **APIs** provide a way to share data in a digital format that computers can understand across the internet (often referred to as *machine-readable* data). 

Not all APIs work the same way and the use of data is strictly regulated by policies of the API provider. The results are sent back as data in a standard data format like XML or JSON.
